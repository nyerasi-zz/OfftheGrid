# OfftheGrid
Off the Grid is a quick location-based app that allows users to post activities of any kind linked to map markers with Google Places integration. Users can add a destination, the number of people needed, the date and time, as well as a description of the planned excursion. Future updates will improve the barebones UI, support messaging, allow users to add images to their posts, and implement a token system to limit spamming. Users can accept a post, and if approved by the poster, enter a group message with the other "recruits" to work out the details of their venture.
